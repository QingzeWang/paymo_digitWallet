	'''
	This class: paymo, is used to build up a graph to represent users' relationship by using the DICTIONARY data structure. The following two methods are included for an paymo_conn object: 1, paymoGraphã€€==> build a users' graph based on current transaction records. 2, paymoDegree  ==> calculate degree between any two users up to 4. 3, Calculate the number of degree and generate 3 different output files. 4, flatten_lists: a short function to change a list_of_list to a list
